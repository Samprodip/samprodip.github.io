[00:00]Bye Bye Baby (Taylorâ€™s Version) (From The Vault)
      [00:12.78]It wasn't just like a movie
      [00:15.87]The rain didn't soak through my clothes
      [00:20.02]Down to my skin
      [00:24.92]I'm driving away, and I
      [00:28.07]I guess you could say
      [00:29.66]This is the last time I'll drive this way again
      [00:37.04]Lost in the gray
      [00:38.56]And I try to grab at the fray
      [00:41.71]'Cause I, I still love you but I can't
      [00:48.86]Bye-bye to everything I thought was on my side
      [00:55.08]Bye-bye, baby
      [01:00.76]I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
      [01:03.35]And all I have is your sympathy
      [01:05.83]'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me
      [01:13.04]Bye-bye, baby
      [01:18.80]Bye-bye, baby
      [01:24.98]The picture frame is empty
      [01:27.54]On the dresser, vacant just like me
      [01:31.49]I see your writing on the dash
      [01:36.83]Then back to your hesitation
      [01:39.38]I was so sure of everything
      [01:42.41]Everything I thought we'd always have
      [01:48.36]Guess I never doubted it
      [01:51.75]Then the here and the now floods in
      [01:54.56]Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
      [02:01.12]Bye-bye to everything I thought was on my side
      [02:07.15]Bye-bye, baby
      [02:12.63]I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
      [02:15.42]And all I have is your sympathy
      [02:17.94]'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me
      [02:25.11]Bye-bye, baby
      [02:33.40]There's so much that I can't touch
      [02:35.81]You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
      [02:39.72]And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
      [02:44.13]And I'm so scared of how this ends
      [02:52.09]Bye-bye to everything I thought was our my side
      [02:58.18]Bye-bye, baby
      [03:03.47]I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
      [03:06.25]And all I have is your sympathy
      [03:09.00]'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me
      [03:15.43]Bye-bye to everything I thought was on my side
      [03:22.04]Bye-bye, baby, yeah
      [03:27.76]I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
      [03:30.59]And all I have is your sympathy
      [03:32.98]'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me
      [03:38.30]Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
      [03:46.29]Bye-bye, baby
      [03:52.16]Bye-bye, baby
      [03:55.94]...
