[00:00]Taylor Swift ~ Welcome To New York
      [00:27]
      [00:28]Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
      [00:31]Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
      [00:36]Everybody here wanted somethin' more
      [00:40]Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
      [00:43]And It Said 'Welcome To New York'
      [00:46]It's been waitin' for you
      [00:48]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [00:52]Welcome To New York
      [00:55]It's been waitin' for you
      [00:56]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [01:01]It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
      [01:09]The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
      [01:17]Welcome To New York
      [01:19]It's been waitin' for you
      [01:21]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [01:27]When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
      [01:31]Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
      [01:35]Everybody here was someone else before
      [01:39]And you can want who you want
      [01:41]Boys and boys and girls and girls
      [01:43]Welcome To New York
      [01:46]It's been waitin' for you
      [01:48]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [01:52]Welcome To New York
      [01:54]It's been waitin' for you
      [01:56]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [02:00]It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
      [02:09]The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
      [02:16]Welcome To New York (New York!)
      [02:19]It's been waitin' for you
      [02:20]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [02:25]Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
      [02:29]Like any real love, it's ever-changing
      [02:33]Like any true love, it drives you crazy
      [02:37]But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
      [02:45]Welcome To New York
      [02:48]It's been waitin' for you
      [02:49]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [02:53]Welcome To New York
      [02:56]It's been waitin' for you
      [02:57]Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
      [03:02]It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
      [03:06]The lights are so bright but they never blind me
      [03:10]Welcome To New York
      [03:11](New Soundtrack...)
      [03:12]It's been waitin' for you
