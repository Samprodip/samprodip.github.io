[00:00]The Best Day (Taylor's Version)
      [00:16.94]I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
      [00:24.72]I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
      [00:32.07]Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
      [00:36.01]Look now, the sky is gold
      [00:40.14]I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
      [00:48.02]I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
      [00:55.63]But I know you're not scared of anything at all
      [01:02.81]Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
      [01:08.64]But I know I had the best day with you today
      [01:15.92]â™ª
      [01:22.28]I'm 13 now
      [01:23.90]And don't know how my friends could be so mean
      [01:29.98]I come home crying, and you hold me tight and grab the keys
      [01:37.28]And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
      [01:44.95]And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
      [01:53.64]I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
      [02:00.79]But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
      [02:08.24]Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
      [02:13.71]But I know I had the best day with you today
      [02:23.89]I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
      [02:31.35]God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
      [02:36.13]He's better than I am
      [02:39.02]I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
      [02:45.84]And I had the best days with you
      [02:54.38]There is a video I found from back when I was three
      [03:01.94]You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
      [03:09.48]It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
      [03:17.44]Daddy's smart
      [03:18.44]And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
      [03:25.49]Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
      [03:32.89]I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
      [03:39.45]And I love you for giving me your eyes
      [03:44.04]For staying back and watching me shine
      [03:47.01]And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
      [03:54.23]That I had the best day with you today
      [03:59.24]...
