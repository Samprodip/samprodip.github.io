[00:00]Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version)
      [00:00]Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
      [00:03]♪
      [00:08]Ha
      [00:10]♪
      [00:13]Ha-ha, time for a little revenge
      [00:17]The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
      [00:20]I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
      [00:24]She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
      [00:27]She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"
      [00:30]I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
      [00:34]I underestimated just who I was dealing with (oh)
      [00:37]She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
      [00:40]She underestimated just who she was stealing from
      [00:45]She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
      [00:48]She's an actress, whoa
      [00:52]He was a moth to the flame
      [00:54]She was holding the matches, whoa
      [00:58]Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
      [01:01]On the playground won't make you many friends
      [01:05]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
      [01:07]There is nothing I do better than revenge (revenge), ha
      [01:13]♪
      [01:18]She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
      [01:21]She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
      [01:25]I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
      [01:28]She thinks I'm psycho, 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
      [01:31]But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
      [01:34]Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
      [01:38]They didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
      [01:41]But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity (think about what you did)
      [01:46]She's not a saint and she's not what you think
      [01:49]She's an actress, whoa
      [01:52]He was a moth to the flame
      [01:54]She was holding the matches, whoa
      [01:59]Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
      [02:02]On the playground won't make you many friends
      [02:05]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
      [02:08]There is nothing I do better than revenge (ha-ha)
      [02:15]I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
      [02:18]You might have him, but haven't you heard?
      [02:22]I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
      [02:25]You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
      [02:32]Whoa
      [02:36](Come on, can you take it back?)
      [02:39](Come on)
      [02:42]She's not a saint, and she's not what you think (no)
      [02:45]She's an actress, whoa (she deserves it)
      [02:48]He was a moth to the flame
      [02:50]She was holding the matches, whoa
      [02:55]Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
      [02:58]On the playground won't make you many friends
      [03:01]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
      [03:04]There is nothing I do better than revenge (come on)
      [03:08]Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
      [03:11]'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
      [03:14]Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
      [03:18]I don't think you do, I don't think you do (come on), let's hear the applause
      [03:22]Come show me how much better you are (feels so much better, yeah?)
      [03:26]See, you deserve some applause
      [03:29]'Cause you're so much better
      [03:31]She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"
      [03:34]...
