[00:00.00] We Were Happy (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)
[00:22.22]We used to walk along the streets
[00:27.81]When the porch lights were shining bright
[00:31.69]Before I had somewhere to be
[00:37.51]Back when we had all night
[00:43.13]And we were happy
[00:49.77]I do recall a good while back
[00:55.15]We snuck into the circus
[00:58.72]You threw your arms around my neck
[01:04.42]Back when I deserved it
[01:10.39]And we were happy
[01:16.69]When it was good baby, it was good, baby
[01:21.21]We showed 'em all up
[01:23.43]No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
[01:27.66]Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
[01:35.16]And we were happy
[01:40.66]♪
[01:45.99]We used to watch the sun go down
[01:51.82]On the boats in the water
[01:55.48]That's sorta how I feel right now
[02:00.98]And goodbye's so much harder
[02:06.86]'Cause we were happy
[02:13.33]When it was good baby, it was good, baby
[02:17.63]We showed 'em all up
[02:19.95]No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
[02:24.27]Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
[02:31.95]And we were happy, we were happy
[02:43.49]Oh, I hate those voices
[02:46.88]Telling me I'm not in love anymore
[02:51.73]But they don't give me choices
[02:55.86]And that's what these tears are for
[03:01.10]'Cause we were happy, we were happy
[03:12.37]When it was good baby, it was good, baby
[03:16.68]We showed 'em all up
[03:18.81]No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
[03:23.27]Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
[03:25.20]And you were gonna marry me
[03:30.75]And we were happy (yeah), we were happy
[03:39.34]Oh-oh-oh, we were happy
[03:46.40]...
